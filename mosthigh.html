        <p> <span class="verse"></span> <span class= w3-text-red> </span></p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Gen_14:19</span> And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Gen_14:20</span> And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Gen_14:22</span> And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Num_24:16</span> He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Deu_32:8</span> When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">2Sa_22:14</span> The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_7:17</span> I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_9:2</span> I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_21:7</span> For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_46:4</span> There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_47:2</span> For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_50:14</span> Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_56:2</span> Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_57:2</span> I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_73:11</span> And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_77:10</span> And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_78:17</span> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_78:56</span> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_82:6</span> I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_83:18</span> That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_91:1</span> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_91:9</span> Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_92:1</span> A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_92:8</span> But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Psa_107:11</span> Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Isa_14:14</span> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Lam_3:35</span> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Lam_3:38</span> Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_3:26</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_4:17</span> This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_4:24</span> This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_4:25</span> That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_4:32</span> And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_4:34</span> And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_5:18</span> O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_5:21</span> And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_7:18</span> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_7:22</span> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_7:25</span> And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Dan_7:27</span> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Hos_7:16</span> They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Hos_11:7</span> And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mar_5:7</span> And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Luk_8:28</span> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_7:48</span> Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_16:17</span> The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.</p>
        <p> <span class="verse">Heb_7:1</span> For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</p>
