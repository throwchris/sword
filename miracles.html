                        <p> <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">5</span> And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there
                            came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">6</span> And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick
                            of the palsy, grievously tormented.
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">7</span> And Jesus saith unto him,<span class=w3-text-red>
                                I will come and heal him.</span>

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">8</span> The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not

                            be healed.
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">9</span>For I am a man under authority, having soldiers

                            to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">10</span>When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">13</span> And Jesus said unto the centurion,<span

                                thee.</span> And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.

                        <p> <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">14</span> And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he
                            saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">15</span> And he touched her hand, and the fever left her:
                            and she arose, and ministered unto them.
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">16</span> When the even was come, they brought unto him
                            many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed
                            all that were sick:

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">17</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">24</span> And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">25</span> And his disciples came to him, and awoke him,

                        <p> <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">28</span> And when he was come to the other side into the

                            exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">29</span> And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">30</span> And there was a good way off from them an herd

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">31</span> So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">32</span> And he said unto them, <span

                        <p> <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">18</span> While he spake these things unto them, behold,
                            there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but
                            come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">19</span> And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did
                            his disciples.
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">20</span> And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an
                            issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">21</span> For she said within herself, If I may but touch
                            his garment, I shall be whole.

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">22</span> But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her,
                            he said,<span class="w3-text-red">Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee
                                whole.</span> And they laughed him to scorn.
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">23</span> And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and
                            saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">24</span> He said unto them, <span

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">25</span> But when the people were put forth, he went in,
                            and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.
                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">26</span> And the fame hereof went abroad into all that

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">28</span> And when he was come into the house, the blind

                            <span class="w3-small w3-opacity">29</span> Then touched he their eyes, saying,<span
