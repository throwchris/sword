        <p> <span class="verse">Gen_1:2</span> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mat_1:18</span> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mat_3:11</span> I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, 
            and with fire:</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mat_3:16</span> And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mat_4:1</span> Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mat_10:20</span><span class="w3-text-red"> For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.</span> </p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mat_12:28</span> <span class="w3-text-red">But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mat_12:31</span> <span class="w3-text-red">Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mat_12:32</span> <span class="w3-text-red">And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mat_28:19</span> <span class="w3-text-red">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mar_1:8</span> I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mar_1:10</span> And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mar_1:12</span> And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mar_3:29</span> <span class="w3-text-red">But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Mar_12:36</span> <span class="w3-text-red">For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span></p><br>   
        <p> <span class="verse">Mar_13:11</span> <span class="w3-text-red">But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Luk_1:35</span> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Luk_1:67</span> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Luk_3:22</span> And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Luk_4:1</span> And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Luk_4:14</span> And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Luk_4:18</span> <span class="w3-text-red">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Luk_11:13</span> <span class="w3-text-red">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Luk_12:12</span> <span class="w3-text-red">For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Joh_1:32</span> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Joh_1:33</span> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Joh_14:26</span> <span class="w3-text-red">But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Joh_20:22</span> And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, <span class="w3-text-red">Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_1:2</span> Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_1:5</span> <span class="w3-text-red">For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_1:8</span> <span class="w3-text-red">But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</span></p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_2:4</span> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_2:38</span> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_4:8</span> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_4:31</span> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_7:55</span> But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_8:15</span> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Act_8:17</span> Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">1Co_6:19</span> What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</p><br>
        <p> <span class="verse">Jud_1:20</span> But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</p><br>
