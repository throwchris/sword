        <h5>Gen_1:2  And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</h5><br>
        <h5>Mat_1:18  Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</h5><br>
        <h5>Mat_3:11  I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, 
            and with fire:</h5><br>
        <h5>Mat_12:31  Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</h5><br>
        <h5>Mat_12:32  And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</h5><br>
        <h5>Mat_28:19  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</h5><br>
        <h5>Mar_1:8  I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</h5><br>
        <h5>Mar_3:29  But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</h5><br>
        <h5>Mar_12:36  For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</h5><br>   
        <h5>Mar_13:11  But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</h5><br>
        <h5>Luk_1:35  And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</h5><br>
        <h5>Luk_1:67  And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</h5><br>
        <h5>Luk_3:22  And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.</h5><br>
        <h5>Luk_4:1  And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</h5><br>
        <h5>Luk_12:12  For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.</h5><br>
        <h5>Joh_1:33  And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</h5><br>
        <h5>Joh_14:26  But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</h5><br>
        <h5>Joh_20:22  And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</h5><br>
        <h5>Act_1:2  Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:</h5><br>
        <h5>Act_1:5  For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</h5><br>
        <h5>Act_1:8  But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</h5><br>
        <h5>Act_2:4  And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</h5><br>
        <h5>Act_2:38  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</h5><br>
        <h5>Act_4:8  Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</h5><br>
        <h5>Act_4:31  And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</h5><br>
        <h5>Act_7:55  But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</h5><br>
        <h5>Act_8:15  Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</h5><br>
        <h5>Act_8:17  Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</h5><br>
        <h5>1Co_6:19  What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</h5><br>
        <h5>Jud_1:20  But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</h5><br>
        <h5></h5><br>
        <h5></h5><br>
        <h5></h5><br>
